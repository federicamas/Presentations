## Motivation {.center} 
::: {.incremental}
- Understand the beneficiaries of different types of programs in Switzerland  
- Provide valuable insights for program optimization
:::

. . .

<h2 class="mt-2">This Paper</h2>

## Policy Trees {.center}

- Outcome of interest: Employment in the third year
- Depth 4 Policy tree

  :::{.incremental}
    - **Unconstrained Policy Tree**: all the individuals are assigned to TEar.
    - **Constrained Policy Tree**: shifts the allocations to NP and splits on past
   earnings
  :::

:::{.incremental}
- **Welfare**: 16 and 3 days more of work than the observed allocation
:::
-->

## Conclusion {.center}

::: {.incremental}

- The heterogeneity analysis indicates that specific sub-groups of the population could benefit from different ALMPs:  
  - explore potential improvements for better programme assignments
  <!-- - Heterogeneity in an more homogenous population may suggest that skill-based characteristics are the drivers more than migration background -->

:::

<h2 class="mt-2"> Improvements </h2>

::: {.incremental}
- What drives the heterogeneity? BGATEs
- How stable are the results? Robustness checks

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Inequality-Adjusted Policy Tree</h2>
<hr class="section-separator">


## Motivation {.center}
::: {.incremental}
- **Policy Learning**: focuses on finding an optimal policy rule that maximizes the utilitarian welfare  
   $$\small Q(\pi) =  \mathbb{E} [Y\left(\pi(X)\right)]$$

- Defining welfare as a means of outcomes misses the distributional impacts of a policy allocation

- Important if the policymaker is concerned about inequality 
:::

. . .

<h2 class="mt-2"> Contribution </h2>

::: {.incremental}
- Integrate insights about policy learning and inequality (Kitagwa and Tetenov (2021), Kock and Preinerstorfer (2024)) into 
 Zhou, Athey, and Wager (2023) algorithm 

- Different from the literature which treats inequality within the fairness framework through penalties or constraints of the objective function (e.g. Frauen et al. (2023), Viviano and Bradic (2023))
:::


## This Paper {.center}

::: {.incremental}

- Adapt the objective function of the Policy-Tree algorithm of Zhou, Athey, and Wager (2023) and employ the Atkinson Index (Atkinson (1970)) as a Welfare measure to accommodate distributional consequencies of policy allocation
- Simulate the assignments to ALMPs for Swiss unemployed individuals
::: 

## Intuition {.center}

::: {.incremental}

- The proposed recursive tree-search algorithm maximizes the estimated reward by iterating through all possible sample splits and treatment states
for each subtree.
    - Returns the associated treatment and total reward, the sum of potential outcomes in each sub-leaf
:::

. . .

<!--
- The split of the Policy Tree is based on covariates and cut points that max the sum of potential outcomes in each sub-leaf, returning the associated treatment and total reward 
$$\small \textbf{Return} \left(\max_{j \in \{1, \ldots, d\}} \hat{\Gamma}_{ij}, \arg\max_{j \in \{1, \ldots, d\}} \hat{\Gamma}_{ij}\right) $$  -->

- The **Atkinson Index** is a measure of inequality that depends on a parameter $\epsilon$, the individual outcome, and the mean outcome of the whole population:
$$ \small A = 1 - \frac{1}{\mu}\left(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N y_i^{1-\varepsilon}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\varepsilon}} $$

- $\epsilon$ allows to express policy maker preferences towards inequality
- $y_i$ and $\mu$ are within the leaf and overall population potential outcomes, same scores of original algorithm

<!--
::: {.incremental}

- Start computing the mean under the observed treatment: $\mu$
- Apply the tree search and return associated treatements and reward maximizes the Atkinson Index using the observed outcome mean 
- Repeat the iterations using the updated values of $\mu$ after the split
:::
-->


## Challenges {.center}
::: {.incremental}
- Better understanding of the results when introducing $\mu$ in the tree search
- Accommodate budgetary constraints: not obvious extension
- Computational complexity can be an issue
- Technical decision on handling continuous variables...
- Motivate better the welfare and policy tree choice

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cluster Robust Causal Forests</h2>
<hr class="section-separator">

## Motivation {.center}
::: {.incremental}
- Interest of empirical researchers in understanding cluster robust inference with classical econometrics and causal machine learning estimators
- Chiang, Kato, Ma, and Sassaki (2021) provide Multiway Cluster Robust DML
- Athey and Wager (2019) and Lechner (2018) adapted the Causal Forest packages to accommodate one-way clustered error settings
  - Cluster-robust standard errors are computed differently and the statistical conditions for valid inference are not clear 
:::

## Causal Forests {.center}
::: {.incremental}
- Athey and Wager (2019): adapt the sampling and prediction procedure for the nuisance functions computation
    - s.e. computed as deviation between the clustered average treatment effect and the average treatment effect
- Lechner (2018): uses an alternative inference method useful for estimators that have a representation as weighted averages of the observed outcome
    -  s.e. weights can be aggregated within clusters
:::

## This Paper {.center}
::: {.incremental}

- Investigates causal forests under clustered sampling environments  
- Explore and adapt sampling or weighting procedure
- Provide a formula or bootstrap procedure to compute the standard errors 
:::

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- Apply the adapted clustered standard errors to an empirical setting
    - National Study of Learning Mindset

:::

  <!-- - Provide a variance estimator designed for causal forests able to accommodate clustering: or estimators that be seen as weighted estimators -->
 <!--  or estimators that be seen as weighted estimators -->
 <!-- what does it means? -->


## Challenges {.center}
::: {.incremental}
- Understand the technicalities of the two estimators and try to provide a general framework
- Understand how clustering changes the heterogeneity analysis
