What happens if you get unemployed in Switzerland?

## Introduction {.center}
::: {.incremental}
**Active Labor Market Policies (ALMP):** Government interventions designed to enhance employment outcomes of unemployed

- **Basic course (BC)**: Orientation and job search skills
- **Training course (TC)**: Language, IT, or vocational training for particular sectors
- **Employment Programme (EP)**: Unpaid work outside the regular labor market
- **Temporary Wage Subsidy (WS)**: Subsidy incentivizing individuals to temporarily accept low-paying regular jobs

## This paper  {.center}
::: {.incremental}

Evaluate heterogeneities in the effectiveness of Swiss ALMPs using causal machine learning and a rich administrative data
:::
. . .

::: {.incremental}
**Contributions:**

- **New data:** Evaluation for a more recent time period

- **New methods:**

    - More reliable estimates
    - Uncover heterogeneity (and its drivers) beyond the average effect, programme that is ineffective on average might still be beneficial for particular subgroups
    - Provide interpretable data-driven recommendations for improved allocations to programmes

## Data {.center}
::: {.incremental}

Dataset from diverse Swiss administrative records (2004-2018)
with individuals entering unemployment between 01/2014 and 06/2015
:::
. . .

::: {.incremental}
**Two samples** analysis depending on migration background:

- **Permanent Residence (PERM):** Swiss and long term migrants
- **Temporary Residence (TEMP):** More recent migrants
:::

<!---->

## Data {.center}
::: {.incremental}

**Outcomes:**

- Employment status and earnings during 36 months after programme start
(monthly and several aggregates)
<!--
- For control group pseudo start dates are predicted based on sample of
program participants
-->
:::
. . .

::: {.incremental}
**Covariates:**

- Employment and earnings history over 10 years
- Socio-demographic characteristics
- Information on prior jobs and unemployment spells
- Regional labor market characteristics

:::

<!--
- ATE $\,\,\,\, \implies \tau_{d} :=  \mathbb{E}[ Y^d - Y^{0}]$\vspace{.1cm}
- BGATE $\implies \tau_{d}^B(z) :=  \mathbb{E}\left[\mathbb{E}[ \,  Y^d - Y^{0} \, | \,  Z = z, W]\right]$\vspace{.1cm}
- IATE $\,\,\implies \tau_{d} ( x ) := \mathbb{E}[ \,  Y^d - Y^{0} | X = x ]$ 
- Optimal Policy $\pi^*=\arg\max_{\pi \in \Pi} Q(\pi)$, where  $Q(\pi) =  \mathbb{E} [Y^{\pi(V)}]$

## Parameters of interest {.center}
::: {.incremental}

**Estimands:**

- **ATE**: average treatment effect for a population of interest
- **BGATE**: average treatment effect for a larger group of interest balanced for a subgorup of the covariates
- **IATE**: average treatment effect for a unit with specific values of covariates
- **Optimal Policy Rule**: a mapping from covariates to treatment which maximise the average outcome under the specific treatment

:::

. . .

**Identification strategy**: selection-on-observables, we observe most of the information caseworkers observe at the point of assignment

## Estimator {.center}
::: {.incremental}

**Modified Causal Forests (MCF)** (Lechner 2018, Lechner and Marekova, 2024)

- Extension of CF (Wager and Athey, 2018) using a splitting rule accounting for heterogeneity and selection
- Harmonized estimation and inference procedure
- No functional form assumptions
- Package freely available: https://github.com/MCFpy/mcf

:::

. . .

::: {.incremental}

**Policy Trees** (Bodory, Mascolo and Lechner, 2024)

- Decision tree designed to optimise treatment assignment policies
- Multi-action policy learner algorithm based on Zhou, Athey and Wager (2023)
- Implemented in the MCF package

## Balanced Group Average Treatment Effects {.center}

- **BC**: More pronounced effects across earnings deciles
- **TC**: No significant heterogeneity related to education or earnings
- **EP**: More beneficial for women than men; no significant heterogeneity with respect to education

## 
### Conclusions {.center}

Investigate the effect of ALMPs in Switzerland

::: {.incremental}

- **Key findings:**
    - **Permanent Residents**: Mixed effects on employment and earnings; only WS shows positive, significant effects
    - **Temporary Residents**: Positive, significant effects for all programmes on the extensive margin


- **Heterogeneity:**
    - Individuals with lower education, non-Swiss citizenship and weaker labour market history benefit more from the programmes
    <!--
    - Driven by immigration background, education labour market history
    -->
    - Statistically insignificant results for the smaller sample of TEMP

- **Simulated allocations:**
    - Increase assignments to WS for both PERM and TEMP samples
    - Use deeper policy trees in PERM, if the all the programmes need to be maintained
