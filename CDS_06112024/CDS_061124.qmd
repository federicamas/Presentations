## Introduction {.center}
::: {.incremental}
What happens if you get unemployed in Switzerland?
![](Swiss_ue_system.svg){width=80% style="display: block; margin: auto;"}

## Introduction {.center}
::: {.incremental}
**Active Labor Market Policies (ALMP):** Government interventions designed to enhance employment outcomes of unemployed

- **Basic course (BC)**: Orientation and job search skills
- **Training course (TC)**: Language, IT, or vocational training for particular sectors
- **Employment Programme (EP)**: Unpaid work outside the regular labor market
- **Temporary Wage Subsidy (WS)**: Subsidy incentivizing individuals to temporarily accept low-paying regular jobs
:::


## This paper  {.center}
::: {.incremental}

Evaluate heterogeneities in the effectiveness of Swiss ALMPs using causal machine learning and a rich administrative data
:::
. . .

::: {.incremental}
**Contributions:**

- **New data:** Evaluation for a more recent time period

- **New methods:**

    - More reliable estimates
    - Uncover heterogeneity (and its drivers) beyond the average effect, programme that is ineffective on average might still be beneficial for particular subgroups
    - Provide interpretable data-driven recommendations for improved allocations to programmes
:::


<!--
**Relevance:**


- More than half of all unemployed are assigned to a programme
- Program that is ineffective on average might still be beneficial for particular
subgroups
- Similar system in many other countries

## Data {.center}
::: {.incremental}

Dataset from diverse Swiss administrative records (2004-2018)
with individuals entering unemployment between 01/2014 and 06/2015
:::
. . .

::: {.incremental}
**Two samples** analysis depending on migration background:

- **Permanent Residence (PERM):** Swiss and long term migrants
- **Temporary Residence (TEMP):** More recent migrants
:::

## Data {.center}
::: {.incremental}

**Outcomes:**

- Employment status and earnings during 36 months after programme start
(monthly and several aggregates)
<!--
- For control group pseudo start dates are predicted based on sample of
program participants
-->
:::
. . .

::: {.incremental}
**Covariates:**

- Employment and earnings history over 10 years
- Socio-demographic characteristics
- Information on prior jobs and unemployment spells
- Regional labor market characteristics

:::

## Econometrics {.center}
::: {.incremental}


**Target Estimands:**

- ATE $\,\,\,\, \implies \tau_{d} :=  \mathbb{E}[ Y_{i}^d - Y_{i}^{0}]$\vspace{.1cm}
- BGATE $\implies \tau_{d}^B(z) :=  \mathbb{E}\left[\mathbb{E}[ \,  Y^d - Y^{0} \, | \,  Z = z, W]\right]$\vspace{.1cm}
- IATE $\,\,\implies \tau_{d} ( x ) := \mathbb{E}[ \,  Y^d - Y^{0} | X = x ]$ 
- Optimal Policy $\pi^*=\arg\max_{\pi \in \Pi} Q(\pi)$, where  $Q(\pi) =  \mathbb{E} [Y^{\pi(V)}]$

. . .

**Identification strategy**: selection-on-observables, we observe most of the information caseworkers observe at the point of assignment.


<!--
## Identification {.center}
::: {.incremental}
**Conditional independence assumption** 

- We observe most of the information caseworkers observe at the point of assignment.
- We condition on key confounders identified in the literature (e.g., Lechner, 2013; Caliendo, 2017).
- We find no evidence for violations in a placebo analysis.
:::

. . .

::: {.incremental}

**Common support assumption**: Random forest to estimate propoensity scores and trimming procedure

**Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption**: No spillover effects

**Exogeneity of covariates**: Only pre-treatment covariates
::: 
-->



## Estimation {.center}
::: {.incremental}
**Modified Causal Forests** (Lechner 2018)

- Causal forest modified for estimation with observational data
- Works particularly well under strong selection (Lechner and Marekova, 2024)
- Harmonized estimation and inference procedure, estimation of ATE, GATE and BGATE is obtained aggregating IATE
- No functional form assumptions

Evolution of ATEs for earnings in the 36 months after programme start for Permanent Residents sample

Lock-in effect with subsequent recovery for all programs
Temporary wage subsidy shows positive effect in the third year (+CHF 200 per month)
Cumulative effects over 36 months mostly negative
Results qualitatively similar to previous findings for Switzerland

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Conclusions </h2>
<hr class="section-separator">

## Conclusions {.center}
::: {.incremental}
Investigate effectiveness of Switzerlandâ€™s active labor market policies

- **Key findings:**
    - **Permanent Residents**: Mixed effects on employment and earnings; only WS shows positive, significant effects
    - **Temporary Residents**: Positive, significant effects for all programmes on the extensive margin


- **Heterogeneity:**
    - Individuals with lower education, non-Swiss benefit more from the programmes
    - Driven by immigration background, education labour market history
    - Statistically insignificant results for the smaller sample of TEMP

- **Improved allocations:**
    - Increase assignments to WS for both PERM and TEMP samples.
    - Use deeper policy trees in PERM to extend employment duration while preserving all the programme
